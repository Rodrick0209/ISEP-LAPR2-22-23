# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Spacifies that:_

- are common across several US/UC: 
- are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

* The class property is present in all user stories ,on the user story 5 the property is a store , on the other one the property is undifined .


## Usability 

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._


* Make recurring tests to evaluate that the user interface is not in error with the various options that the user can choose;
* The user interface needs to be simple to the user navigate;
* The interface must support at least the English language since it is the main language of the country.

## Reliability
_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._

* The system must run every day,at every hour.
* the software must be secure and protect personal and confidential information. 


## Performance
_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._


* The system should be quick in all the tasks (max: 3 secs);


## Supportability
_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._ 


* The software should be easy and cheap to maintain.
* The software should have some updates to improve the app when necessary.
* The app should have an email and a contact from the company to clients have contact with it when they are unable to submit the characteristics of the property.

### Design Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the system design process. Examples may include: programming languages, software process, mandatory standards/patterns, use of development tools, class library, etc._
java, html,css. A non-interactive functionality to run and store and organize data for example, and an interactive fucntionality to interact with the agent for example. "Property" is going to be one of the main classes.
Each subject of the US is gonna be a class .


java (or python but probably java ),java .jar to build graphs,


### Implementation Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the code or construction of a system such
such as: mandatory standards/patterns, implementation languages,
database integrity, resource limits, operating system._
