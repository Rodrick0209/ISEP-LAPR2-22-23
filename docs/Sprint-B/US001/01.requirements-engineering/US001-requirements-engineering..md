# US 001 - To display listed properties (unregistered user) 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As an unregistered user, I want to display listed properties.



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	The possible owner can browse available properties in a specific area and get an idea of the market 


>	The goal is to find something that meets his needs and budget, and then persuade him to register for an account to start the process of buying or renting it 



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Does the unregistered user need to login or register to see the list of properties?
>  
> **Answer:** No, the unregistered user does not need to login or register to see the agency list.


> **Question:** What specific information about the properties will the unregistered user be able to see in the list?
>  
> **Answer:** This will depend on what has been defined as basic agency information. This information includes the agency type, number of rooms, price, location and a photo. The unregistered user may not have access to more detailed information, such as full descriptions, additional features or seller contact information.

> **Question:** Will there be any information about the availability of properties on the list?
> 
> **Answer:** Normally, the availability of properties is updated in real time, but it may be that the information is not available in the list. The unregistered user may need to click on a specific agency to check its updated availability.
